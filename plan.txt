REVISED PLAN 

@ Oct 7th, 3:30am, Thursday: 
1. Service_inventory is the only workable dataset
2. The file itself contains years from 2016 to 2020 but the actual comments that can be used appear 2017 onwards (plus!)
3. Comments are made up of telephone (tel), person (person), email (eml), online(onl), fax, post(mail), and other(oth). 
4. Point being, what amongst the mentioned above can I include as a part of Digital Tracking
(and something like post which has nothing do with Digital [I guess if you include package tracking or something] 
could I include it as well?)
5. And yes, the idea pretty much is same as the last time, automation would look a lot different because 
this time instead of working two together I am working just one but with multiple strings in those cells 
(and that would be the challenge yk?) 
Basically, when I get a concrete idea on how many have what digital service inv comments for what years those go up 
the same way as a graph and then we finish it. 
Now the thing is idk how long it will take to wrap it up so like we discussed I'm taking the end of Oct also because I
have my reading week last week of Oct so I can give time to my projects (one of them being this yk)
