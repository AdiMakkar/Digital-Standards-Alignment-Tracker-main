        <h1>Digital Standards Alignment Tracker</h1>
        <hr id="darkred">

        <p>Our goal is to provide public services to Canadians which are simple to use and trustworthy. The Government of Canada’s Digital Standards form the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused. They will guide teams in designing digital services in a way that best serves Canadians.</p>
       
        <button class="accordion">Digital Tracking context</button>
        
        <div class="panel">
        <p></p>
        <p>This page represents the Digital Standards working in the open to share the analysis of alignment with the Digital Standards</p>
        <p>The information displayed here does not represent any form of performance or metrics tracking on behalf of 
            Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) or the Government of Canada (GC).</p>
        <p>The anonymized information being shared is in the spirit of Open Data and Working in the Open, to share information
            regarding the alignment to the Digital Standards.
        </p>
        <p>This page is currently a prototype, and more information will be added as work progresses.</p>
        <p>This data is generated through analyzing submitted concept cases. Work is underway to improving our data collection 
            and reporting to remove subjectivity as much as possible. For the time being, this is the data at hand, and we
            are actively working to improve the quality and quantity of said data.
        </p>    
        <p>A concept case was judged whether or not it aligned with a Digital Standard. This means if the concept case
             identified that it had met a given Digital Standard, but was judged not to have adequately
            met the standard, then it will result as having not aligned in the data below.</p>
        <p>Work is presently underway to provide further guidance regarding what would be considered to align
            with a Digital Standard. In the spirit of working in the open, the work presently underway can be viewed

        <h3>Design with Users</h3>

        <p>Research with users to understand their needs and the problems we want to solve. Conduct ongoing testing with users to guide design and development.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Design with Users</button>
        
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Services should not be built based upon internal constraints or complexities of government, they should instead be built to address the needs of all users.
            To deliver value to users, one must understand and prioritize their needs. The value of a given service or initiative is a hypothesis until tested with the users of our services. 
            As such, services should not be designed against detailed information proxies such as requirements documentation or Requests for Proposal, as these are only hypotheses. 
            Assumptions need to be validated through direct and frequent interactions with a representative sample of users, who may be members of the public, or government employees or a combination thereof.      
            At the end of the day, requirements for services are built first and foremost with the needs of all users in mind. 
            The division of services in terms of their <a href = "designindex.html"> percentages over the course of 3 years (2017-2019)</a> showcases how needs evolved 
            and the number of services grew while making sure the design concept also implements easy and safe access.</p>
        </div>
        <hr> 

        <h3>Iterate and Improve Frequently</h3>

        <p>Develop services using agile, iterative and user-centred methods. Continuously improve in response to user needs. Try new things, start small and scale up.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Iterate and Improve Frequently</button>
        <!--
        <div class="panel">

        </div>
        -->
        <hr> 

        <h3>Work in the Open by Default</h3>

        <p>Share evidence, research and decision making openly. Make all non-sensitive data, information, and new code developed in delivery of services open to the outside world for sharing and reuse under an open licence.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Work in the Open by Default</button>
        <!--
        <div class="panel">

        </div>
        -->
        <hr> 

        <h3>Use Open Standards and Solutions</h3>

        <p>Leverage open standards and embrace leading practices, including the use of open source software where appropriate. Design for services and platforms that are seamless for Canadians to use no matter what device or channel they are using.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Use Open Standards and Solutions</button>

        <hr> 

        <h3>Addressing Security and Private Risks</h3>

        <p>Take a balanced approach to managing risk by implementing appropriate privacy and security measures. Make security measures frictionless so that they do not place a burden on users.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: EAddressing Security and Private Risks</button>
        <!--
        <div class="panel">
      
        </div>
        -->
        <hr> 

        <h3>Build in Accessibiity from Start</h3>

        <p>Services should meet or exceed accessibility standards. Users with distinct needs should be engaged from the outset to ensure what is delivered will work for everyone.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Build in Accessibiity from Start</button>
        <!--
        <div class="panel">
    
        </div>
        -->
        <hr> 

        <h3>Empower Staff to Deliver Better Services</h3>

        <p>Make sure that staff have access to the tools, training and technologies they need. Empower the team to make decisions throughout the design, build and operation of the service.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Empower staff to deliver better services</button>
        
        <div class="panel">
        <p>In order to promote innovation and create agility within our organizations, the teams that make up our organizations must be empowered. 
            Aim to hire good people not to tell them what to do, but to have them tell you what to do. Ensuring professional advancement is available to retain high performers throughout their career.</p>
        <p>The government manages large, highly complex, crucially important services for their users. 
            A top-down command and control approach to service delivery and designs enforces a structure that aligns to the structure itself, rather than to the needs of the users or based on the expertise of those building the services. 
            Rather than bringing information to authority, bring authority to the information. Those best suited to solve a given problem are those closest to the problem.
            By removing decision-making authority from the teams into complex governance structures, the innovative potential of teams is mitigated by legacy governance procedures and processes.</p>
        <p>In order to create organizations that are able to create high quality services and iterate and improve frequently, teams must be empowered to make decisions for themselves. 
            Therefore the following outlines the alignment of the Digital Standards under the condition of 'Empowering Staff to Deliver Better Services.'</p>
        <p>The following link displays the averages with respect to eight separate questions that function all throughtout the number of years (2014, 2017-20) and represent all the subsets that report them.
            Furthermore <a href="empowerindex.html"> the availability of further subdivision on comparisons with respect to positive and negative specific subsets of specific years</a> can also be viewed for better understanding. 
        </p>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h3>Be Good Data Stewards</h3>

        <p>Collect data from users only once and reuse wherever possible. Ensure that data is collected and held in a secure way so that it can easily be reused by others to provide services.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Be Good Data Stewards</button>
        <!--
        <div class="panel">
       
        </div>
        -->
        <hr> 

        <h3>Design Ethical Services</h3>

        <p>Make sure that everyone receives fair treatment. Comply with ethical guidelines in the design and use of systems which automate decision making (such as the use of artificial intelligence).</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Design Ethical Services</button>

        <hr> 

        <h3>Collaborate Widely</h3>

        <p>Create multidisciplinary teams with the range of skills needed to deliver a common goal. Share and collaborate in the open. Identify and create partnerships which help deliver value to users.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Guidance: Collaborate Widely</button>

        <hr>
        <p>Since every Digital Standard tracks different years, it is possible systematic errors may arise. 
            This can be fixed further by segregating ten standards over the following years,</p>
